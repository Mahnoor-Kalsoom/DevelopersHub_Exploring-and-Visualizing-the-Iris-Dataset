# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## Description
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing the **Iris dataset** using Python. The goal is to understand data trends, relationships, and distributions by applying basic data analysis and visualization techniques.

The dataset is loaded and inspected using **pandas**, and visualizations are created using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

## Features
- Load and inspect the dataset using pandas
- Display shape, column names, first few rows
- Generate summary statistics using `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Visualize data using:
  - Scatter plots for feature relationships
  - Histograms for value distributions
  - Box plots to identify outliers

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- VS Code (as IDE)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
